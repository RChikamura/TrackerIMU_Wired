  "description": "The small, low power BMI160 is a low noise 16-bit IMU designed for mobile applications such as AR or indoor navigation, providing highly accurate sensor data and real-time sensor data. The low current consumption of BMI160 enables always-on applications in battery-driven devices. This sensor features a configurable on-chip interrupt engine which provides motion-based gesture recognition and context awareness as always-on background functions.",
